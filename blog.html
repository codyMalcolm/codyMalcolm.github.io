	            	<h3>Introduction</h3>

	            	<p>Hello and welcome to codyMalcolm.com! Eventually, this site will demonstrate my breadth and depth of skills as a developer. For now, I've only been learning for about a month, so please excuse me while I continue acquiring the knowledge to get everything set up properly. For now this will be more of a journal, and I'll "post" at the end of each day what I learned and worked on that day.</p>

					<h3>How I got to here</h3>
	            	<p>My current curriculum:</p>
	            	<ul>
	            		<li><a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a> - This is where I started, and I am just wrapping up the Front End Libraries Certification. I have made a personal commitment to complete at least one new lesson or project a day, even if I am focusing on different courses at the time. <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/codymalcolm" target="_blank">Track my profile.</a>
	            		</li>
	            		<li><a href="https://wesbos.com/" target="_blank">Wes Bos'</a> <a href="https://javascript30.com/" target="_blank">30 day Javascript coding challenge</a> - As of July 28th, I have completed up to day 6 of Wes Bos's program and every day I learn a lot of new techniques. This course is exceeding my wildest expectations. I will definitely take several of Wes' other courses once this one is completed.
	            		</li>
	            		<li><a href="https://codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">Codecademy.com</a> - I have taken several courses on codecademy, including "Introduction to JavaScript" and "Learn the command line." I find the frequent hands-on "PRO" projects very helpful to reinforce practical application of the taught concepts. Generally, once I have completed my other daily commitments and any other targeted learning, I spend the rest of my time working on a codecademy course. I plan to complete the React courses and then the JQuery course next, and then continue working on the freeCodecamp curriculum as a priority.
	            		</li>
	            		<li><a href="http://gedd.ski/" target="_blank">Dave Geddes'</a> <a href="https://flexboxzombies.com/p/flexbox-zombies" target="_blank">Flexbox Zombies</a> - This "course" makes mastering flexbox fun. At the author's recommendation, I do only one chapter a day to take advantage of the benefits of spaced repetition.

	            	</ul>
					<br />
					<p>Next steps:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Besides for the blog, I also have some pretty cool projects in mind that require backend skills. I know I need PHP, so I'll make that my next priority.
